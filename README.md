Brand Redesign: I redesigned the game development company Square Enix's website. Mobile responsive. 

Final Project: I designed a Studio Ghibli fan page. Originally it contained a section to view all the movies along with information pulled from an api but the api no longer works. The other parts of the site, the image gallery and tier list maker still function as intended.

Module 5: A calendar project. You can log in to add events to your calendar as well as editing and deleting events. Events can be shared between users. A color coded category can be added to events. HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL.

Module 6: A live chat room project. Users can send messages and images in different chatrooms and create public and private chatrooms. HTML, CSS, Node.JS, Socket.io

Creative Project: My partner and I created a site to track and group movies that you have watched or intend to watch. It includes a functional search bar at the top that will show suggestions based on your query. Clicking on the thumbnail for a movie will bring up more information on it and allow you to add it to a list, rate it, or add a comment if you are logged in. Created with a React frontend, express backend, and a MySql database.
